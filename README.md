This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Tcl related to the use of the `expr` command and the `==` operator. The bug arises when comparing a variable that might be undefined or contain a non-numeric value. The provided code shows the bug, and a solution is offered to fix this issue.  The solution focuses on robust input handling and more explicit type checking to avoid unexpected behavior.
